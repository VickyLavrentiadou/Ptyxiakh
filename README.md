Sentiment Analysis contains the main code of the project. 
Reviews from Amazon products have been attained in order to achieve classification with the help of Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, 
and Random Forest. The classification process (testing and training) will determine,
the positive or negative nature of the testing data (reviews). 
The predicted positive or negative reviews are evaluated (Accuracy, F1-score, Precision-Recall, Classification Report, etc).

Before being processed the data are balanced (imbalance.py).
Plots of the process evaluation are created.
